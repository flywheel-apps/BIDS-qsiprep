# BIDS-QSIPREP

## About
qsiprep configures pipelines for processing diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) data. The main
 features of this software are 
 
1. A BIDS-app approach to preprocessing nearly all kinds of
 modern diffusion MRI data. Automatically generated preprocessing pipelines that
 correctly group, distortion correct, motion correct, denoise, coregister and resample
 your scans, producing visual reports and QC metrics.

1. A system for running state-of-the-art reconstruction pipelines that include algorithms
from Dipy, MRTrix, DSI Studio and others.

1. A novel motion correction algorithm that works on DSI and random q-space sampling
schemes


### Preprocessing 
The preprocessing pipelines are built based on the available BIDS inputs, ensuring that fieldmaps are handled correctly. The preprocessing workflow performs head motion correction, susceptibility distortion correction, MP-PCA denoising, coregistration to T1w images, spatial normalization using ANTs and tissue segmentation.

## Overview
This gear can only be run on datasets that have been BIDS curated
and can pass the tests of the [BIDS
Validator](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator).
BIDS curation can be done before uploading data to the Flywheel
platform, or DICOM files can be uploaded and BIDS curation can be
done on the platform (see Setup below).

This Gear requires a (free) Freesurfer license. The license can be
provided to the Gear in 3 ways. See [How to include a Freesurfer
license file](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360013235453).

This gear can run at the project, subject or session
level.  Because files are in the BIDS format, all of the proper
files will be used for the given session, subject, or separately,
by subject, for the whole project.

## Setup: BIDS Curation
Before running BIDS curation on your data, you must first prepare
your data with the following steps:

1. Run the [SciTran: DICOM MR
Classifier](https://github.com/scitran-apps/dicom-mr-classifier)
gear on all the acquisitions in your dataset.  This step extracts
the DICOM header info, and store it as Flywheel Metadata.

1. Run the [DCM2NIIX: dcm2nii DICOM to NIfTI
converter](https://github.com/scitran-apps/dcm2niix) gear on all
the acquisitions in your dataset.  This step generates the Nifti
files that this gear needs from the DICOMS.  It also copies all
flywheel metadata from the DICOM to the Nifti file (In this case,
all the DICOM header information we extracted in step 1).

1. Run the [curate-bids gear](https://github.com/flywheel-apps/curate-bids)
on the project.  More information about BIDS Curation on Flywheel
can be found
[here](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360008162154-BIDS-Overview)
and running the BIDS curation gear is described
[here](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360009218434-BIDS-Curation-Gear).
If you need to rename sessions or subjects before curation, you may
find the gear helpful:
[bids-pre-curate](https://github.com/flywheel-apps/bids-pre-curate).

1. Run the gear on a session, subject, or project.

Steps 1 and 2 can be automatically carried out as [gear
rules](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360008553133-Project-Gear-Rules).

These steps MUST be done in this order.  Nifti file headers have
significantly fewer fields than the DICOM headers.  File metadata
will be written to .json sidecars when the files are exported in
the BIDS format as expected by the BIDS App which is run by this gear.

## Running:
To run the gear, select a
[project](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360017808354-EM-6-1-x-Release-Notes),
[subject](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360038261213-Run-an-analysis-gear-on-a-subject)
or
[session](https://docs.flywheel.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015505453-Analysis-Gears).

Instead of running at the project level which will sequentially
step through each subject, you can launch multiple jobs on subjects
or sessions in parallel.  An example of running the gear on a subject
using the Flywheel SDK is in this [notebook](notebooks/run-gear.ipynb).
More details about running gears using the SDK can be found in this
[tutorial](https://gitlab.com/flywheel-io/public/flywheel-tutorials/-/blob/ad392d26131ef22408423b5a5c14104253d53cd6/python/batch-run-gears.ipynb).
